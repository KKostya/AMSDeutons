* Adding a cut in preselection
** Linearly extrapolated trajectory of the TOF hit positions passing both tracker layer 1 and 9
But we need TOF cluster location in the data for that

* Checking the new NTuple variables
** Investigating Francesco's sigma distribution of TOF edep
Francesco has produced sigma distribution of TOF Edep with MC but when plotted on our data the sigmas don't match
** Francesco distance variables: why are there some peaks

* Compare beta and rigidity resolution matrices obtain from proton MC and deuton MC
