* Current tasks
** implement gradient method

* Cuts
** To be added in preselection:
Linearly extrapolated trajectory of the TOF hit positions passing both tracker layer 1 and 9.
But we need TOF cluster location in the data for that
** investigate chargeOne
The current chargeOne selection kills A LOT of deuterons.

* Checking the new NTuple variables
** DONE Investigating Francesco's sigma distribution of TOF edep
Francesco has produced sigma distribution of TOF Edep with MC but when plotted on our data the sigmas don't match
** Francesco distance variables: why are there some peaks


* Systematics
** MCMC systematics
*** Investigate the effect of uncertainties on beta and rigidity matrices resolutions on the MCMC output
The beta and rigidity matrices are known with uncertainties on their content.
We need to build a toy model to investigate the effect of these uncertainties on the MCMC output.
1. Generate toy matrices by applying fluctuation in every cell of our beta/rigidity matrices
2. run the MCMC and look at how the output varies

*** Compare beta and rigidity resolution matrices obtained from proton MC and deuton MC
