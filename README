DEPENDANCE:
_The bigQuery project: git@github.com:wizmer/bigQuery.git. Add it to your PYTHONPATH

USAGE:
1) If the tables 'AMS.cutoffs' and 'AMS.timeInSecInData' need to be recreated, delete them (this can be done at: https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/queries/ams-test-kostya) and then run:
      ./tableManagement/createCutoffTable.sh 
      ./tableManagement/createTimeInSecInDataTable.sh

   These queries require to process the entire dataset and might be expensive in term of money (I am not so sure)

2) python run.py
